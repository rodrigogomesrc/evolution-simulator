# evolution-simulator
A basic simulator built in python to see the impact on the population when some parameters are changed

That was the ideia of this project until I realized while doing it that it's too slow for what I intended. So I intent to rebuild it in C++ later.

So it's a incomplete project. There's the population simulator part, but not the evolutional features as it should have.
